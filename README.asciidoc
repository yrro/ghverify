== ghverify

Use Github's API to verify a signed tag in a repository.

You'll need to create a https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens[personal api token] to provide to the script. The token only needs access to read from the target repositories.

=== To build

    $ ./gradlew installApp
    
=== To run

    $ build/install/ghverify/bin/ghverify api_token owner repository tag

=== Known issues

Tag objects include a UTC timestamp and a UTC offset, and both are required in order to construct the tag's digital signature. As a workaround I assume that the machine's default time zone (as determined by Java) was the one used when creating the tag object. This will become a command line parameter soon.
Strangely, Github's API documentation imply that the offset is included in the data
